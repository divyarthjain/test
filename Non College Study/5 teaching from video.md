Vision in the Long Term Over Short-term Gains

A long-term vision focuses on strategies and actions that yield significant benefits over an extended period. Most often, this implementation is made for one to sacrifice immediate gains so as to set a foundation for great future success. The creation of the concept of long-range vision is driven by the creation of sustainable growth and lasting success rather than instant gratification.

As is mentioned in "The Parable of the Pipeline," instead of running around with buckets, Pablo is busy constructing a pipeline. Now, while Bruno earns his petty earnings per bucket carried, Pablo is busy investing in the construction of the pipeline. Finally, the pipeline results not only in an always available water supply for Pablo but also results in a passive income much, much higher than what Bruno has earned, at least for the time being.

Example: Long term vision in personal finance, like investment in stock market or real estate, not consuming the money to satisfy immediate luxuries. In business, putting huge investments into research and development to produce innovative products is going to rule the future market.

Value of Patience and Effort Over Time

Success is great and lastingâ€”it requires patience and long-term efforts. There are many valuable endeavors that take much sustained effort and the ability to forbear through difficulties with no immediate gain. Patience keeps one on, although the going might be slow.

Example: Pablo's project of the pipeline has been a big struggle for him through the hard times; thus, a lot of trouble and delay were on his way, but in the end, he still managed to bear this goal in his mind. His patience paid when the pipeline began to deliver water continuously; henceforth, it gives him an income that is good and sustainable.

Application: It may represent further training or education in a specific field, such as the results of such an investment that may take years to achieve but finally provide more satisfactory work and income. Applied in personal goals, a good example would be a long-term health and fitness plan that requires consistent effort but results in durable well-being.

Leverage and Collaboration

Leverage is knowing how to get the most use out of everything, including other people's time and their abilities. Collaboration is working with others to pool resources, ideas, and efforts for a common mission. Both underline that very often success necessitates teamwork and smart mutilation of available assets.

For this parable, it's not specifically said, but the inference of the principle is probably this: time may eventually come when, very simply, adding people or partnering with others who have different skill sets and an expertise not held by oneself may need to be considered to help scale the project and do so more efficiently.

Application: In business, leveraging and collaboration could be in the form of delegation of duties to employees or partnering with other companies for expanding market reach. For personal projects, it could imply seeking advice from mentors or teaming up with friends in order to accomplish common goals.

Innovation and non-standard thinking

Innovation involves the creation of new ideas, methods, or products that are better than what is already in place. Thinking "out of the box" is an inventive way of solving problems and coming up with alternatives in a manner divergent from the expected conventional ways. The two will be key to keeping competitiveness in the solution of complex challenges.

Example: The very idea of putting a pipeline was just about Pablo's mind for the solution to carrying water. Everybody was thinking about how to carry water in the buckets, but Pablo thought creatively and innovated a better way to do this. This culminated into continuous and passive income that came long after. Application: The ability for the industry is to innovate in making software or gadgets, which will make a difference in how humans can interact with the world. Daily life in out-of-the-box thinking would be inventive solutions for saving both time and money, like apps that might automate routine work.
