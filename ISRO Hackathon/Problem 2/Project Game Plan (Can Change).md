**Project 2: Generation of Rooftop Solar Energy Potential Map Using Machine Learning/Deep Learning Based Building Footprint Extraction**

This project strikes a balance between complexity and feasibility. It leverages existing technologies and methodologies that first-year students can understand and implement with guidance. There are available resources and tools that can be adapted, making it possible to produce a simplified, functional proposal and solution within the 7-day timeframe.

**Key Steps to Achieve This:**

1. **Divide the tasks among the team:**
    
    - One student focuses on gathering satellite imagery and pre-processing.
    - One student works on training or adapting ML/DL models for building footprint extraction.
    - One student handles the calculation of solar potential based on sun position and weather data.
    - One student develops the web application for visualization.
2. **Use existing libraries and tools:**
    
    - Utilize pre-trained models and geospatial libraries.
    - Leverage open datasets and existing APIs for solar energy calculations.
3. **Simplify the scope:**
    
    - Focus on a small geographic area for proof-of-concept.
    - Implement basic versions of each task to ensure functionality over perfection.

By focusing on this project, the team can produce a detailed proposal and a working prototype that demonstrates the core concept within the given constraints.
